# Getting started using EO 

1. What data are we talking about?
2. Which data to use?
3. Where to get the data?
4. How to get the data?
5. Processing EO data

# What is your level of experience with...

* optical EO
* RADAR/SAR
* other/general EO

# How to decide which data to use?

**What information is needed?**

* structural vs spectral characteristics
* details
* time series

**Budget?**

**Handling**

* experience 
* pre-processing needs


# Where and how to get data?

# Mosaics

# Geocubes

# FinHub

# Paituli

[www.paituli.csc.fi](https://paituli.csc.fi)

* ~13 TB data with webbased data preview
* spatial data download service
* some EO data products, possible reference data 
* open to anyone, unrestricted access
* includes historical versions of datasets
* not limited to Finland


# download vs data and processing platforms

# What to consider when choosing a place to get data from?

# What to consider when choosing a method to download data?

# Own suggestions


# How to process the data?
> general considerations, GUI vs CLI vs Python/R/Julia/Matlab/...

# GUI

# CLI

# Python/R/Julia/Matlab,...


# A few common EO processing steps
