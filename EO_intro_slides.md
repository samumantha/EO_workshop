# Practicalities

* Let's discuss a lot
* Many presentations, but please ask questions
* Mentimeter: www.menti.com; 2773 8461
* Accessibility in hybrid event

# Today

* Introduction round
* EO data and processing (general)
* CSC resources for EO
* Use cases of EO research using CSC resources
* Discussion time / Ask us anything

# Introduction

* Who are you?
* What is your research about?
* What would you like to get from this workshop?
-> Mentimeter

# Getting started using EO 

1. What data are we talking about?
2. Which data to use?
3. Where to get the data?
4. How to get the data?
5. Processing EO data

# EO data 

> Poll: what type of EO data have you used? (optical multispectral, hyperspectral, LiDAR, RADAR, none, specify)

# How to decide which data to use?

**What information is needed?**

* structural vs spectral characteristics
* details
* time series

**Budget?**

**Handling**

* experience 
* pre-processing needs

---

# Where and how to get data?

# Mosaics

# Geocubes

# FinHub

# other "hubs"

# Paituli

* ~13 TB data
* spatial data download service
* some EO data products, possible reference data 
* open to anyone, unrestricted access
* includes historical versions of datasets
* publish own geospatial datasets -> URN
* webbased data preview
* not limited to Finland
* annual usage reports

# Paituli access

**OGC webservices:**

* WMS (maps, map image for viewing)
* WMTS (maptiles, map image tiles for viewing)
* WFS (features; vector data)
* WCS (coverage, raster data

**Download:**

* webinterface,
* bulk download: http, ftp, rsync

# download vs data and processing platforms

# What to consider when choosing a place to get data from?

# What to consider when choosing a method to download data?

# Own suggestions

# How to process the data?
> general considerations, GUI vs CLI vs Python/R/Julia/Matlab/...

# GUI

# CLI

# Python/R/Julia/Matlab,...
