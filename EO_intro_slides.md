# How to decide which data to use?

**What information is needed?**

* structural vs spectral characteristics
* details
* time series

**Budget?**

**Handling**

* experience 
* pre-processing needs

# What kind of EO data are you interested in?

* optical multispectral
* hyperspectral
* RADAR/SAR
* LiDAR
* other

# Where and how to get data?

* Mosaics, Markus Törmä (SYKE)
* Geocubes, Lassi Lehto (FGI/NLS)
* FinHub, Mwaba Hiltunen (FMI)  
* Paituli
* Other data sources
* Considerations
  
# Mosaics

# FinHub

Mwaba Hiltunen (FMI) 

# Paituli

[www.paituli.csc.fi](https://paituli.csc.fi)

* ~13 TB data with webbased data preview
* spatial data download service
* some EO data products, possible reference data 
* open to anyone, unrestricted access
* includes historical versions of datasets
* not limited to Finland

# Other data sources

* [Copernicus Open Acces Hub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/)

# Download vs data and processing platforms

* Puhti, Google Earth Engine (GEE), Amazon Web Services (AWS), Sentinel Hub, DIAS-services, ...
* setup
* costs
* efficiency
* availability
  
# What to consider when choosing a place to get data from?

* download methods
* costs
* license

# What to consider when choosing a method to download data?

* Web interface or other Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)
  * visual checking
  * search parameters
* Application Programming Interfaces (API)
  * scripts
  * file lists
  
# Our suggestion

* Search in web interface 
* Download via script
* sentinelsat (Python)

# How to process the data?

* Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)
* Command Line Interfaces (CLI)
* own code: Python/R/Julia/Matlab/...

# Graphical User Interface - GUI 

* Good for testing and prototyping workflows and visualization of the results
* Problems with reproducability
* Possibility to create models/graphs and export them as scripts
* Free and open source options: SNAP, QGIS, OrfeoToolbox (OTB), ...

# Command Line Interface - CLI

* No need to code (but it helps)
* Manuals/documentation
* Acces to super- and cloud- computing 
* Eg. GDAL, FORCE, SNAP GPT, OrfeoToolbox (OTB), ...
  
# Python/R/Julia/Matlab,...

* Flexibilty 
* Reproductibility
* Parallellization
* Learning curve
* Good community support and tutorials
* Many different options and packages for EO
* Access to super- and cloud- computing 


# A few common EO processing steps

## Optical multispectral

* atmospheric correction
    -> Sen2cor, FORCE, OTB, ...
* cloud identification and masking
    -> FORCE, SNAP, Python (s2cloudless), R (sen2r), ...
* calculation of (vegetation) indices
    -> raster calculator / band math / map algebra: QGIS, SNAP, Python (rasterio, numpy), R (sen2r), ... 
* zonal statistics 
    -> QGIS, Python (rasterstats), ...

# A few common EO processing steps

## RADAR

* Radiometric Calibration
* Terrain Correction
* Inferometry
* Polarimetry

-> SNAP, sarpy, OTB etc.

# A few common EO processing steps

## Any

* download
    -> Python (sentinelsat), R (sen2r), ...
* mosaicing
    -> Python (sen2mosaic, sen1mosaic), ...

# What software do you use and for what?
