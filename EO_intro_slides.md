# Getting started using EO 

1. What data are we talking about?
2. Which data to use?
3. Where to get the data?
4. How to get the data?
5. Processing EO data

# What is your level of experience with...

* optical EO
* RADAR/SAR

-> www.menti.com; 2773 8461


# How to decide which data to use?

**What information is needed?**

* structural vs spectral characteristics
* details
* time series

**Budget?**

**Handling**

* experience 
* pre-processing needs

# What kind of EO data are you interested in?

* optical multispectral
* hyperspectral
* RADAR/SAR
* LiDAR
* other

# Where and how to get data?

* Many sources of EO data are covered in our tutorial
* Costs and efficiency
  * Web interface vs API
  * Downloading vs virtual machine next to the data 
* download vs data and processing platforms
* what to consider when choosing a place to get data from?
* What to consider when choosing a method to download data?
* Own suggestions:
    * good experience with ASF and batch scriptin using wget
    * Sentinelsat Python package
  
# Mosaics

# Geocubes

# FinHub

# Paituli

[www.paituli.csc.fi](https://paituli.csc.fi)

* ~13 TB data with webbased data preview
* spatial data download service
* some EO data products, possible reference data 
* open to anyone, unrestricted access
* includes historical versions of datasets
* not limited to Finland

# How to process the data?

* Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)
* Command Line Interfaces (CLI)
* own code: Python/R/Julia/Matlab/...

# GUI 

* Good for testing and prototyping workflows and visualization of the results
* Problems with reproducability
* Possibility to create models/graphs and export them as scripts

* Free and open source options: SNAP, QGIS, OrfeoToolbox...

# CLI

* No need to code
* Manuals/documentation

* Eg. GDAL, FORCE, SNAP GPT, OrfeoToolbox (OTB)
  
# Python/R/Julia/Matlab,...

* Flexibilty 
* Reproductibility
* Learning curve
* Good community support and tutorials

* Many different options and packages for EO 
  
# A few common EO processing steps
